# GLSL Shader (WebGL) Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate setup using webpack and babel to edit GLSL Shaders in the brower (comes with live reload thanks to webpack dev server).

Shaders are located in /src/shaders

## Usage
#### `npm run build`
Build a production version of `bundle.js` into `dist/`.

#### `npm run watch`
Watch files in `src/` for changes, recompile on change.

#### `npm run dev`
Run a development server at `http://localhost:8080/`. This also will watch & recompile on file changes.
